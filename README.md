# The Embedded RISC-V web site

This repository stores the actual, live, Embedded RISC-V project web.

## URL

Thanks to the Travis magic, commits to this Git are automatically reflected at [http://emb-riscv.github.io](http://emb-riscv.github.io).

## GitHub Pages

As all GitHub Pages webs, this is a fully static site.

## Jekyll

This is a Jekyll generated site, but since it uses plug-ins, it cannot be automatically processed by GitHub Pages, and requires the build to be performed off-line.
